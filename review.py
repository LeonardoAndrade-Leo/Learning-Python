# In this review, I'm seeing some concepts as Data Types, variables

# Data Types
# 1) int: usually numbers without a fractional component, like (1, 2, 3, -5)
# 2) float: numbers with fractions (1.2, 0.6)
# 3) bool: it represents true or false values 
# 4) str: it represents a sequence of characteres, as words, phrases, digits (hello, 44+33,3)

nome= 'leonardo' # Variables: piece of memory where we keep some data. To create a variable, we must follow some naming rules. 
print(nome) # here, I wrote a command that when executed, the value of the variable 'nome', will appear on the screen
